# ElDolarJuarez
This was a website to find the best exchange for usd to pesos in Juarez

This project showed to the user the best deal to either change Pesos to Dollars or Dollars to Pesos in the city of Juarez, based on their location.
This was a complete project with a fully functional backend for authors to add, remove or edit the business information.
El Dolar Juarez was a project meant to solve a problem in all border city's (USA-MEXICO)
We started with the city of Juarez Chihuahua that has a border with El Paso Texas.
The problem was when people wanted to exchange Pesos to Dollars or Dollars to pesos, there are multiple options(business) in the city 
but knowing the more convenient is hard and time consuming.
